# Sorting Algorithm Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes and compares six sorting algorithms:  
- Bubble Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Quick Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Heap Sort  

The goal is to evaluate their **theoretical vs. actual performance** by measuring:  
✅ Execution time (measured using `clock()` in C)  
✅ Number of comparisons  

Results are stored in a **CSV file** for further analysis, allowing for easy visualization and comparison.

## 🔧 Implementation Details  
- **Language:** C  
- **Input:** Randomly generated arrays of different sizes  
- **Performance Metrics:** Execution time & number of comparisons  
- **Output:** CSV file containing recorded performance metrics  

The program is modular, enabling easy addition of more sorting algorithms if needed.

## 📊 Results & Findings  
This study helps understand:  
- How sorting algorithms behave in real-world scenarios  
- The impact of dataset size on performance  
- Differences between theoretical complexity and practical execution  

Graphs and tables are used to visualize the findings.
